# nvim-simple-config

A simple and minimal Neovim configuration.

## Features
- Lightweight and fast
- Pre-configured with essential plugins
- LSP (Language Server Protocol) support
- Diagnostics (errors, warnings, navigation)
- Key mappings for efficient editing

## Backup Existing Config
Before installing this configuration, it's recommended to back up your existing Neovim configuration:

```bash
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim_backup
```
This renames your current Neovim folder to nvim_backup so you can restore it anytime.

Clone the repository into your Neovim config directory:

```bash
Copy code
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/rida-hdj/nvim-simple-config.git ~/.config/nvim
```
Open Neovim
